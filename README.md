# Assignment Instructions
Imagine you have been hired by a company to implement a website that will market their new and improved product, the Epsilon 3!! 

You can choose anything to be Epsilon 3, a new shoe, a flying car, a home pet neutering system, whatever. That can be up to your own imagination.

The website MUST use CSS, pleasant colors and fonts, be easy to read and maneuver with clear and distinct links, including epsilon 3 features, epsilon 3 options, and epsilon prices. You can add additional pages as desired. 

In addition you MUST include at least THREE of the following, based on your design.

1. drop down menus
2. slide bar for scrolling
3. slide show/gallery
4. login form for access etc. or a response form
5. file upload button 
6. search button

# Website Details
I chose to incorporate:
1. Drop down menus
2. Slide bar for scrolling
3. Slide show/gallery
4. Response form

into the site.

* A drop down menu will appear after hovering over the About section in the navigation bar.

* The navigation bar implements javascript and CSS to provide a slide-in and slide-out effect as the user scrolls.

* A slideshow gallery that flips thorugh images every few seconds automatically has been added to the bottom of the site.

* A sudo response form. Github pages does not allow the use of server-side languages such as PHP, so JavaScript was set up to mimic this feature. The response form does not actually send messages.
